  Reference card for the full ponytail set — three intensity levels
  (lite / full / ultra), six skills and how they differ, how to disable the mode
  and where to configure the default. Use when you cannot remember which
  ponytail skill fits the task, or on triggers "ponytail help",
  "what ponytail commands", "how to use ponytail", /ponytail-help.
  One-shot display: changes no mode and writes nothing.

# Ponytail Help

Display this reference card when invoked. One-shot, do NOT change mode,
write flag files, or persist anything.

## Levels

| Level | Trigger | What change |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Lite** | `/ponytail lite` | Build what's asked, name the lazier alternative in one line. |
| **Full** | `/ponytail` | The ladder enforced: YAGNI → stdlib → native → one line → minimum. Default. |
| **Ultra** | `/ponytail ultra` | YAGNI extremist. Deletion before addition. Challenges requirements before building. |

Level sticks until changed or session end.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **ponytail** | `/ponytail` | Lazy mode itself. Simplest solution that works. |
| **ponytail-review** | `/ponytail-review` | Over-engineering review: `L42: yagni: factory, one product. Inline.` |
| **ponytail-audit** | `/ponytail-audit` | Whole-repo over-engineering audit: ranked list of what to delete. |
| **ponytail-debt** | `/ponytail-debt` | Harvest `ponytail:` shortcut comments into a tracked ledger. |
| **ponytail-gain** | `/ponytail-gain` | Measured-impact scoreboard: less code, less cost, more speed. |
| **ponytail-help** | `/ponytail-help` | This card. |

Codex CLI uses `$ponytail`, `$ponytail-review`, and `$ponytail-help` (or `/skills`); Claude Code
and OpenCode use the slash-command forms above (OpenCode ships all six as
slash commands).

## Deactivate

Say "stop ponytail" or "normal mode". Resume anytime with `/ponytail`.
`/ponytail off` also works.

## Configure Default Mode

Default mode = `full`, auto-active every session. Change it:

**Environment variable** (highest priority):
```bash
export PONYTAIL_DEFAULT_MODE=ultra
```

**Config file** (`~/.config/ponytail/config.json`, Windows: `%APPDATA%\ponytail\config.json`):
```json
{ "defaultMode": "lite" }
```

Set `"off"` to disable auto-activation on session start, activate manually
with `/ponytail` when wanted.

Resolution: env var > config file > `full`.

## Update

> **Local note (this machine):** these six skills are installed as plain folders in
> `~/.agents/skills`, not as the marketplace plugin. The `/plugin` flow below therefore does
> **not** apply here, and neither do the two Node lifecycle hooks: there is no auto-activation
> at session start and no `PONYTAIL_DEFAULT_MODE` / `~/.config/ponytail/config.json` resolution
> — invoke `/ponytail` explicitly. Updating means re-copying `skills/*/SKILL.md` from the repo
> (see `~/.agents/skills-cheatsheet.md`, section “⚙️ Maintenance”).

Enable auto-update once: open `/plugin`, go to Marketplaces, pick ponytail, Enable auto-update. Claude Code then pulls new versions at startup (run `/reload-plugins` when it prompts). Manual refresh: `/plugin marketplace update ponytail` then `/reload-plugins`.

If `/plugin` is not recognized, your Claude Code is out of date. Update it (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest`, or `brew upgrade claude-code`) and restart. Other hosts use their own update flow.
